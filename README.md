## Mission Statement

_To create a free, open-source, generic, and modular website-builder for consumers (similar to Squarespace and Wix) that comes with a mixture of built-in templates and functionality and allows for developer-driven customizability._

## Goals
#### Core:
+ Give users an efficient way to make a website
    + Dynamic website with built-in Content Management System
    + Live-editing of content
+ Allow users to customize website 
    + Create and utilize pages seamlessly
    + Toggle sub-applications (blog, email newsletter,user accounts, etc.)
+ Provide users with generic themes that will help with the development process
+ Include documentation for developers and users

#### Stretch:
+ Create sub-applications that users can toggle on and off whenever
    + Blog - for diary-style updates such as changelog, personal updates, portfolio, etc.
    + Newsletter / email management - Keeps track of subscribed emails and potentially makes dynamic or automated newsletter
    + User account system - Allow for the addition of users for other uses like tracking comments and newsletter subscribers
+ Theme builder - Allows the user to change the global appearance of the website such as color, font, etc.

## Developer Guidelines - How to contribute

Currently, this project is not open to development to other contributors. We, _The [B]est Group_, are working on the process, guidelines, and documents to help new developers add to our project. Details will be released soon.

Primarily, we will have an issue tracker, discussion board, and wiki sections on this GitHub repository to help keep everyone (customers and co-contributors) updated and informed about this project. This will help with version and update tracking, make sure people who visit the repo understand what is happening, and will be the centralized location for all information about this project.

## Communications Channels 

At present, there are no formally established communication channels, however, there might be a Slack or Discord channel appearing soon.

## Documentation

Documentation will be outlined and created once the idea is solidified and we have a starting point.
